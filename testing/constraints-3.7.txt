# This constraints file is used to check that lower bounds
# are correct in setup.py
# List *all* library dependencies and extras in this file.
# Pin the version to the lower bound.
#
# e.g., if setup.py has "foo >= 1.14.0, < 2.0.0dev",
packaging==17.0
# Make sure we test with pandas 0.24.2. The Python version isn't that relevant.
pandas==0.24.2
